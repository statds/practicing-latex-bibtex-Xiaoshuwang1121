\begin{abstract}
 How we built a pension model for Ghana.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Use this section to answer three questions:
The informal sector represents over 80% of Ghanaâ€™s workforce. There is no formal structure in place to provide adequate retirement benefits for the informal sector by workers or the government.
There wasn't any pension for informal sector worker in Ghana.
I worked with my colleague to build this model.

To cite a reference, here are examples.
\citet{xie2015dynamic} did something ... \lipsum[1]

A lot of work has been done \citep[e.g.,][]{xie2015dynamic}.

Some parametric bootstrap sample size approach was proposed by
\citet{dwivedi2017analysis}. 


% roadmap
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The data will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:data}.
The methods are described in Section~\ref{sec:meth}.
The results are reported in Section~\ref{sec:resu}.
A discussion concludes in Section~\ref{sec:disc}.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

Use this section to describe the data that helps to answer your research
questions. Recall Defined contribution equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mc2}
  [
    &V_0\ =\ C*(1+I_1)^T+M*(\frac{1-(\frac{1}{1+I_1})^T}{\frac{I_1}{1+I_1}})*(1+I_1)^T,
  ]
[
Contribution period =\ T\ =\ A_1-A_2 \\
]
\end{equation}
\lipsum{1}

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

Use this section to present the methodologies that will generate results by
analyzing the data. Suppose that the radius of a circle is $r$. Then its area is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:area}
  \pi r^2.
\end{equation}

Equation~\eqref{eq:area} is interesting. \lipsum[1-4]

Sometimes I don't want an equation to be numbered such as this one:
\[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( - \frac{x^2}{2} \right),
\]
which is the density of a standard normal variable.



\section{Results}
\label{sec:resu}

Table~\ref{tab:rv} summarizes some example draws from some distributions.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

What are the main contributions again?
Build a pension scheme for Ghanian people
What are the limitations of this study?
Lack of mortality table
What are worth pursuing further in the future?
popularize this pension product
